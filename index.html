It had been  MollyÂ´s favorite book since  collage. and the longer she  spend in these four walls  the more she self she  needed to be free. </p>
    <p>She had spend the last  ten  years in this room. <br> sitting under a poster with an Oscar wilde quote proclaiming that <q>work is refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. <br> Although many considered her pioneering work. unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>. <br> to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
